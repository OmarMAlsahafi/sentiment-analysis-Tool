"I buy two phones, a few days one of her horn damaged handset, and could make the refund through amazon (for that I thank you), but a month will damage the horn to the other, so I think that the phones have a serious problem with atrial horn."
"The phone had battery issue in just 3 months. The phone can not be charged at all and the phone can not be turned on. The phone has been sent to the manufacture in Nov. 2015 but has not been fixed yet as of today Jan 22, 2016. We are not satisfied with the poor quality of the phone and the poor customer service of the manufacture and won't suggest to buy BLU product."
This phone is no good. Is not working.my money waste.it never works .the phone keep on restarting
"Phone I got was REALLY slow and laggy! I hate it compared to the BLU Studio 5.0C HD Quad Core I purchased last year! That phone rocked!! Thought I was buying the same one again, as that what seller showed in photos; however, that is NOT what arrived!"
My dad loves this phone. No issues at all. Why spend $700 on a phone? It's completely unnecessary.
"Terrible battery, horrible internal storage. Almost all my apps are on my microsd, but I have uninstall apps and then reinstall them to update them because the phone is perpetually full."
"Purchased this phone for my mother's birthday in May 2015 and to my surprise the phone is no good within 5 months. Not sure what the problem is with this phone but it shuts down and each time it is powered on it takes hours to function and just shows BLU and loading on screen, and at times nothing shows on screen. The battery goes very fast and any attempt to charge shuts the phone off. Please let me know if there are any known ways fix out there for these issues, as I do not have the resources to replace this phone and feel so bad for having my mom do away with her other phone for this crappy one."
I bought this a few months ago my girlfriend. Battery is horrible. She has to restart the phone all the time; has to re-login to apps frequently. It's a pretty messed up phone. Lots of disappointing aspects.
This phone sucks and It wnt let me use it with out wifi and wnt let me send pic messages and have done everything they told me to do and still is not working at all and would like another phone or something
"I like the color of the phone (orange). It is easy friendly to operate. So far my only disappointment is the camera. It has a 8mp back camera and a 2mp front facing camera. The pictures are lousy. The still pictures are grainy, fuzzy, and blurry and there isn't any way to correct it. I searched for a phone with a lot of megapixel so I can do video chat with my 2 yr old granddaughter who lives out of states. I can't do it because the video is so terrible. Very disappointed."
It sucks
"Horrible battery, always lagging, can't connect to any wifi connection. DO NOT buy. No Wifi capabilities, cannot use at all."
No good
"the phone did not work after five months of use, very poor quality"
Its exllant phone but batery not good
I am very disappointed with this phone. It does not work half the time. I will be talking on it and it will just reset itself. It crashes all the time. Apps stop working after a couple of minutes. The phone will freeze up and not do anything unless you take the battery out and restart it that way.
Horrible!
"very bad , poor quality, wifi disconnects every few minutes , warmed when loading is very slow. I did not like anything,I would not return because I am in mexico"
