"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,5,This phone is absolutely fantastic for the price. I will never own another expensive name brand Android again... The processor is quick and not laggy for regular uses. I don't game or use graphic intense apps on my phone so i cannot attest to its performance there.,0.0,Neutral
"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,I bought this phone for my wife as a birthday present this year. I would give it a five star but its lack of handling apps gives it a 4. Battery dies fast when you use apps on it. She has it running with Net10 service and it works great! She loves it and overall its a great buy!,0.0,Positive
"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"I have been using this phone for several months. Overall it works good.

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,5,"Absolutely everything it says it is. It's quick, handles everything I need it to, the battery was surprisingly better than I expected. It's more than sufficient and all of the worries I had upon ordering were quickly laid to rest upon receipt. The video, speaker, speed, call reception, and otherwise overall performance were all very impressive for the delightfully low price of the device. Keep in mind that I'm coming from the impressive uses of a Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I was sick of paying an unnecessarily large phone bill and decided to bring my own device to a much more cost effective provider. (Works great with Cricket by the way)If I had ANY complaints (and I mean if I absolutely HAD to say something wasn't perfect) maybe I would just say that every once in a while, when my device is sending AND receiving too much information at the same time, sometimes I have to go to the quick settings in the notification bar and toggle my WiFi connection off then back on (by the way this takes less than 2 seconds) and to be honest that's because I tend to really push my phone. This only really happens when I'm trying to load a web page and someone just happens to be sending me a picture or something at the exact same time. When my page won't load, I toggle the connection (again, takes just half a sec) and then I see whatever incoming message was trying to push through as my page loads. And when I consider the ridiculously low price of such an otherwise top notch device, I think to myself, ""I can definitely live with that."" I am so happy with my device. I'm relieved to not have to pay expensive phone bills or device costs for such a wonderfully pleasing device on 4G service. I'm a serious power user who doesn't want to completely drain my wallet. And the cherry on top? It's an eye pleaser. Just saying. Phones can sometimes be like people: Great inside, not so pretty on the outside or vice versa. Not that it's the first thing I look for but it's nice to have a device that's just a pretty as it is functional. Definitely worth the price and I am very happy.",2.0,Positive

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,3,I purchased this phone with H2O as my carrier and the phone did not have full functions . It would not send or receive pictures as part of the text messaging. My carrier insisted that this was because it was a BLU phone and that they have not been able to have a single one of these phones work. I really like this phone. It was very sharp looking. The display was bright and colorful. I really wanted it to work. So this is just a heads up to H2O users that there's a good chance this phone will not work for you.Update: after quite the process they were able to get the picture messages to work but it is still has some glitches. Just a couple other things to note. This phone got pretty hot at the top of the phone where you would be holding it while talking. The battery is located lower in the phone so I am not sure why this was happening. Maybe that explains why the phone is having issues. Also the charging port is pretty cheap. The charger kept falling out if it was barely touched.,1.0,Positive
"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,5,"Its bigger than I expected but it works well. Camera is fantastic. @Update!!! this phone is still hanging in there strong!

The sound and camera work great, the touch screen is responsive, and we downloaded recorded videos to our computer with the USB cable easily (once we figured it out). The user manual leaves a lot to be desired in terms of detailed instructions, but most of our questions were answered online anyway. There was a light-duty cover that came with the phone, but I had already gotten the heavier one recommended on Amazon. I've dropped the phone a couple of times with no damage occurring. As to the wrinkles....I couldn't text pictures until I went into the AT&T store, and they plugged in their password under the access point names setting. Then it was fine. I also noticed that using data is like a power-vacuum on the battery, it's dead in a couple of hours. But I don't use it often (only while traveling), and I try to limit/disable the apps to preserve the battery life. Talk and text alone will allow the battery to last 2 days in my experience. For my needs, it's like I just got $500 in my pocket by choosing this phone.",1.0,Neutral

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,Overall this is a great phone to have its a nice size and works well. The only thing is when you charge your phone up it says 100% charged but as soon as you take it off the charger for 2-5mins the battery percentage starts to drain. I think this is a defect because the battery last all day and when talking on the phone sometimes it sound like the volume low.. I also had a little trouble activating my phone I had to call the one eight hundred number they did it for me.,1.0,Neutral
"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,5,"I bought the white 8G version of this phone last week. I am extremely happy with my purchase! BUT, It is a real pain in the ass to get the sim and straight talk all working together. I love this phone BETTER than my Galaxy S4! It's interface is soooooo simple. It really is made for human beings! It does not come pre-tethered to facebook or virtually any other apps for that matter. but that is nice because u get to pick and choose ur own apps from Google Play. This phone was $300 cheaper than my Galaxy. The screen resolution is beautiful. No hesitation or lags in videos. It looks and feels like a solid well-built phone. My brother has the exact same model and he loves his too. The camera is high definition and looks wonderful. I actually had to turn my brightness down just to save battery. It is almost too bright and vibrant. Just turn the brightness down a litttle bit. It saves the battery too. With very moderate use after 2 charges, I am able to get two full days out of the battery. Do yourself a huge favor and buy this phone. Except for the setup aggrivation it will blow u away. Also... make sure one of ur first downloads is an app killer, otherwise the device will run out of memory. Just keep hitting that app kil;lert everytime u use the phone and u shouldn't ever run out of memory.",53.0,Positive

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,Ok so I got this in march of this year. I put some games on it and and I play them a lot. Now I try to play one game and my battery is dead within ten minutes. This is not good I have battery saver apps and that does not help. The rest of it is ok but it does no good if it will shut off on you within a couple minutes of using it.Update:After looking online for a replacement battery and not finding anything withing the price I wanted. I was about to give up on the phone and buy something else. In a last ditch effort I looked at the compartment for the battery. To me it seems a little over-sized. So I took a small piece of card-stock and wedged it in there to force the battery closer to the terminals. After doing that I am no longer having any problems with the battery. If the company would make the compartment a little smaller or the battery a little bigger it would be fine. i am back to liking the phone again.,0.0,Neutral

What's worse is that they first said they'd send a replacement within 5 days, but when one didn't show up, I called back and was told that the rep was undereducated and wrong, and I'd have to mail it in to be repaired and go without a phone for 2+ weeks.",0.0,Neutral

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,5,"I can not say alot about this phone because I bought it thinking my phone was broken which it ended up not being. But I will say the short time I had it before sending it back it seemed like a very good phone for the price and the fact that it is a no contract unlocked phone, which can be used on many networks, and it is a dual sim phone, which if you like me do not know what that means, it means you can either have one sim in for personal and one for business, or one for US and one for international, whatever you choose which is way better than having to carry around two different phones. Mind you I did not use this feature. I do wish it had SWYPE but it did not. Also the color choices are amazing and very true to color. It comes with a matching semi transparent silicone case of matching color. Aswell as headphones, charger, screen protector etc...It is made of cheaper plastic and is very light weight in the hand. I also had no problems when it came to the return, they refunded me right away and I sent the phone back and there were no issues.",2.0,Positive

Issues with this phone I find irritating are: swiping the screen to unlock automatically opens the camera - no option to make it stop. The auto fill of words while texting is beyond irritating when it makes up words you had no intention to use - unable to turn it off. The phone vibrates when the person you call picks up and they can hear it - something else that has no option to turn off. Even with a very clean screen, sometimes it's unresponsive. The pros of the phone are: the screen size, the graphics are decent, battery life is adequate, ability to add storage (unlike the Nexus phone I previously had). sound is good (don't expect symphony hall out of any phone).

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,2,"BEWARE: If 4GB of memory is not enough for you, the external SD Card memory is usable on a very limited basis.

Only 4 of apps on my phone could be moved to the SD Card. Also I have not found a way to move videos and pictures to the SD card. Therefore be aware that this phone has very low storage ability even though it has a SD Card slot. There is currently no space left to be able to update the operating system. The workaround for this is to ROOT the phone and load work around apps which are not supplied by bluproducts. ROOT of the phone voids the warranty.The phone is quite good for the cost and works well otherwise...

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"I really, really like this phone although I have to stress that I came to it from using first a hand-me-down Motorola which was good but pretty outmoded followed by a cheapo phone I bought as a temporary replacement when the Motorola failed at a critical juncture then kept for more than a year. So far this phone (which I brought at a substantial discount on Prime Day and which has been supplanted by at least two newer versions) has lived up to everything I expect of a smartphone. I have it loaded with apps and it hasn't slowed down in the least from its factory condition. The sound clarity is good; the screen is clear, the settings are easy to use. I get excellent service even in a remote beach area I patrol regularly and where I previously was always nearly barless.My only complaint is the battery which seems to plummet after reaching an indication of 50% - have already drained it more than I want to think about. Second, and this may be unique to my set - is that no charger I have been able to find fits securely in the port. I will plug it in to charge at bedtime and wake to find it completely drained - apparently a butterfly had passed by and dislodged the cable.

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"Got this phone for my girlfriend...from the image on Amazon, the color seemed more fuchsia, but in reality it's more hot pink. The phone itself runs very well so far, and it's easy to setup if you have experience with android phones. It comes with plenty of apps bundled and really not much bloatware. The package includes a charger, an earphone, a case protective cover, and screen protective cover. The camera takes pretty good pictures and has a lot of options. The phone runs smoothly thus far without any problems. My girlfriend does not game with the phone so I can't tell you if that would affect the performance of the phone. The phone comes installed with Kitkat OS. The phone also notifies you if you want to upgrade to newer version, but it seems to come up with a network error when I continued with the upgrade. So, not sure if the phone can be upgraded, since in other reviews some people are having trouble with upgrading the phone. Other than that, the sound quality is good, but could be better. The screen is vibrant and clear. Overall, a great phone for it's price and it's working out for my girlfriend. If you're looking for an inexpensive replacement, or an entry phone, you should look into this one.Update: My girlfriend had the phone for over an year and still loves it. For anyone else thinking of getting a BLU phone for long term use, an issue has arised that I think it's important to know. The screen on my girlfriend's BLU phone cracked by itself due to stress fracture over time. She did not drop her phone at all and had the case cover on. However, she did not apply the protective screen cover. The replacement touch screen is about $15, but the plastic touch screen is pretty thin. Not really worth it at this point since the phone still works well even with a large crack on it. For those thinking of getting the phone, just be aware of the plastic touch screen; especially if you are female and tend to tap the screen with your finger nail.",0.0,Neutral

The phone itself seemed nice.The first problem was the Sim card. It takes the largest size. Like flip phone from the 80s big. Off to the at&t store. Got a Sim card after enduring the ridicules of the at&t associate.Second problem. This is not a 4g phone for at&t. 3g only. It is kind of 4g for some networks, but not really.Third problem. It would not connect with mobile data at all. WiFi was fine but nothing mobile. Tried all the settings and tips I could find online. No data.Fourth problem. It would lock up all of the time and require battery removal to reboot.Fifth. No text messages. At this point it would only make actual phone calls and slowly surf on WiFi.I ordered a HTC Desire 610 from Amazon and returned this piece of BLU. Amazon was great and quick with the refund.

The pros are it does all the basic stuff your standard smart phone should. Nothing flashy or great, just average to good.But here is where this phone goes from ""ok"" to ""worthless"":- Randomly shuts down or restarts for no reason. Sometimes in the middle if using an app or or phone call- shuts down and won't restart without removing and replacing battery pack- camera is so bad it cannot take a picture that isn't blurry- call quality is only slightly better than a pay phone in rural Uganda- key pad is laggy and frequently unresponsive while texting or typing- the body and structure of the phone is 80% plastic making it flimsy and brittleIf you need a phone to get you by for a few months till your upgrade is available, this phone is ok.

Also you can remove installed apps from screen. But this phone does not come with all that useless garbage. I love the fact that I just swapped my Sim card from my old phone into the Blu phone and chaged my APN setting to NET10 which was already programmed into the phone!! YES!! There are at least 4 other companies pre-programed. This phone plays Netflix with No issues. The Sound of calls are very loud and clear to hear though the speaker phone unlike the Cubot P9. The screen is very nice and responsive. The phone moves quickly. overall as of now this is the Best Cheap phone money can buy And I've bought alot of cheap phones!! hopefully this will be my last.

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"This phone is amazing for the price. You get 1GB RAM and 8GB storage. It is very fast and smooth. Keeps up pretty well on games. Has a truly beautiful HD screen. It runs nearly stock Android Kit Kat. There are no built-in Facebook, BLU or whatever apps.. It's so stock I had to get an app to play Windows Media Player files!It doesn't do LTE, but it runs 4G on AT&T network as long as you put your sim in slot 1. I use GoPhone. It has two full size sim slots. It had the right APN settings from the start. I've been using a Samsung Rugby Pro for my everyday phone, and the BLU seems to run the browser and apps faster. The micro usb charging/data port is on top, which is a little weird. Actually, it allows you to put your phone in a car cup holder while charging without turning it upside down. Not a big issue, but kind of convenient.The lock button is on the right side and volume rocker is on the left. The speaker gets pretty loud playing media, and the earpiece is just loud enough for phone calls. Wi-Fi and bluetooth connectivity are pretty good. BLU even sends you a screen protector, soft case, earbuds, usb charging cable and AC wall adapter.I really enjoyed this phone, until I noticed how quickly the battery drops off. If the phone is just sitting around idle, the battery holds up pretty well. Just checking email or web browsing will cost you significant battery life. Watching videos will drain it faster. I started the day out with 84%, and was down to 15% by 4 or 5 pm. I listened to Spotify for about a half hour in the morning, then listened to the music player for about 50 mintues on bluetooth headphones. The screen was off while I was listening to music of course. I didn't make any long phone calls, and I did a little texting.I know I'm not the first person to complain about the battery. It's a shame, because everything else about this phone is great. It will do everything you would expect out of a budget phone, and do it well. Just make sure you have a charger handy. If this phone had a better battery, it would be hard to beat.I'm going to try the newer model Studio 5.0 C with Android Lollipop and see if that does any better.{{ Update }} I tried the 2015 Studio 5.0 C with Lollipop. While it does have better battery life, it doesn't perform nearly as well as the 5.0 C HD. The new model also has a slightly smaller screen. I have returned both phones now. I wish I would have kept the 5.0 C HD! I'm seriously considering ordering it again. It is asking a lot of a $100 phone to perform well and have good battery life.{{ Update 7/2/15 }} I ordered this phone again, and I am very happy with it. I've been using it for a couple weeks now, and the battery issue isn't as critical as I had thought. If it's fully charged in the morning, it will last you all day with moderate use. I've gotten most of two days out of it a couple times. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid budget phone with a great screen.",2.0,Positive

In 10.5 min it went from 100% to 83% and that was on wifi while adjusting the power saving features. It seems as I played with it that it didnt drain if I didnt use it, but when I did use it, even just for small things it drained quickly. Its sad really because it felt great, reacted great, nice screen size, but I didnt get into much more since I got caught up in trying to stop battery drain.

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"I really was hesitant about this phone and others like this. Most new phones are $300+. I thought something was going to be really terrible about it. However, being a poor college student I had no choice but to get a cheaper phone.I received this phone and have now been using it for a few weeks. I compare this to my husband's phone (new samsung) and I am very pleased with it. It is only a little slower (not by much) than his, and a little grainier photos. Other than that, I have some bonuses he does not have on his Samsung. Duel sim card, costs only $90, and comes in pretty rad colors. Also cam with a case and screen protector. This phone also has lots of case options online.The small differences this phone has can never add up the $300 difference in my opinion. This phone is pretty amazing for the price. I think even if I could get the more fancier phone, I rather save the money since the differences are very small in my opinion.The two things that do kinda drive me crazy I hope they change is the charging port is at the top of the phone and not the bottom. It makes it hard to talk while it is charging or even use the phone. Second, it constantly says second sim card is missing. I don't use it, and wish it would turn off the notification. Other than that, this phone is pretty darn awesome! I will be back to review it in 3, 6 months and then a year.",1.0,Neutral

I have alsoused this phone with a AT@T sim card threw Net10. So Ihave tried the dual sim card method, works just as stated,one phone 2 different numbers. Was easy to set up after Iread the instructions & made sure the software wasupdated & the APN settings were changed per theinstructions. I love the live photo function, which I haventseen on any of the other smartphones & the FM radioplays great but you must have the ear plugs in becausethey have a built in antenna, but u can play threw thespeakers on the phone. Its HD 5.0 screen is just as big as theiphone 6 & the samsung 5 and works just as good withoutthe high price. Will definitely order another Blu &recommend to others. Make sure to order a phone casethrew Amazon when u order the phone.

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,I just recently purchased one of these phones. I love the screen quality and the speed is on par with my dads galaxy s5. Picture quality from the camera is pretty good considering it is only 8 mp. Front facing camera could be a little better but good enough. If your a heavy user either bring a portable battery or be near a plug cause you'll need it. But if you are an average user battery life is very decent. The screen takes up most of the battery but for good reason. Would like to see a 2600 or 3000 mhv battery for purchase to upgrade would definately make a good selling point for the phone.,2.0,Positive

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,3,"It's not as great as my old Lumia 810two major problems I'm experiencing with this phone:1. Low Battery life2. Wifi/Data constantly dropsBatteryThe Blu Studio 5.0 C HD has a 2000 mAh battery. Which I thought was a step up from my Lumia 810's 1800 mAh battery. Big mistake. When I begin my day with 100% charge, I can just leave it on and do nothing and watch the percent drop in a matter of minutes. If i leave if in my pocket with the screen locked and turn off wifi, and data, and all location services, AND have the phone running in ""power saver mode"" with the brightness all the way down, I find that it loses 5% charge in about 10-15 minutes. This is atrocious. I'm scared to watch what happens when I actually use the phone. When I do use it to the max, with a few apps running and wifi on, i watch it lose about 10% per 2 minutes. Yes the display is 720p but that shouldn't be a problem. The windows OS must use little power or something because my lumia could last me at least one and half days. Only now, after two years, it has begun to lose charge faster, but still can get a full day of use. The lumia has a smaller display coming at 4.3"" and a really low res of 480x800 but it has a smaller batter too yet it still lasts longer than the Blu.WIFI/Databoth this phone and my old lumia 810 from about two years ago have up to wireless n and 4g hspa+ however, the blu studio 5.0 c HD constantly drops from the network. It says that it's still connected to wifi and data, but it does not update anything. I don't get new hangout/facebook messages and I can't use the browser. It only begins to work once I turn off wifi and then turn it back on, and same with data. I'm guessing this is an OS problem and i'll see if I can try it with a custom rom.If the charging port on my Lumia wasn't broken, I wouldn't have switched to this phone. I'm thinking of just getting the wireless charging shell for the lumia and a qi plate and then just using the blu only for the few android apps it offers that I need that I can't get on windows phone.",5.0,Neutral

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,5,"Just received my phone- I haven't even taken it from the plastic. My very first thought is that the dimensions stated on the Amazon page are wrong.It lists it as being 5.1"" long. Perhaps they accidentally left out a 7 in the middle of that number. It is actually around 5 3/4"". Knowing this would have made a big difference in my selection- I chose it thinking it was smaller than others. I see now at least one reviewer posted the correct dimensions, in metric, which I do understand, but still tend to think in inches and hadn't made the conversion.Now, to unpack it and see what it's like, or go back to the Blu selection to see if there is another phone of this larger size I would prefer...?I carried on with it, and so far (still first day), I have no complaints. No hoops to jump through to set it up- put in my T-Mobile PAYG sim and my O2(UK) one, it took a minute or two, but they both popped up and messaged me. It looks good, works well, does what it's meant to do. My buddy I called to test it said it sounds good. I haven't really put it through web paces yet, but it has to be better than what I was getting with my old phone (HTC Desire S).I'll let you know as I learn more.[Two weeks later]Still no problems. As many have mentioned, it may not have the best battery life but I just plug it in to my laptop when I'm home- I've yet to run out of battery.It has been pointed out that this phone isn't true 4G, but it is HSPA+, which is what T-Mobile offers and it works just fine- light years faster than my old HTC.For the price, especially considering what the name brand ones go for, I can't imagine expecting more. I'm changing my rating from 4 to 5 stars.",19.0,Positive

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"First, this phone is replacing a Nexus 5 with horrific disfigurements on its glass screen that rendered it unusable for daily use. This phone though, at its price point, is an absolute steal. BLU has really done something great by offering a price range for unlocked phones below the 200 USD mark. The packaging was clean and enhanced the phone's initial charm (the inclusion of earbuds, case, and screen protector were an absolute plus). Its version of KitKat (Android 4.4) is relatively stable with most popular apps I use (e.g., Strava and Instagram) and is bundled with useful apps such as a file manager, fm radio app, and a sim management app. One can't help but feel (from a U.S. consumer perspective) that this phone is ideal for international travel given the dual-sim card feature.Additional characteristics make this phone standout. The camera is surprisingly apt at taking pictures from both front and back (although there is some focus lag that users will have to be patient with). The colors on the screen are vibrant and the viewing angles are as BLU describes them on their product page. As many of the phones on the market today don't have a removable battery, the BLU 5.0 C HD was a breath of fresh (or old depending on how you look at it) air; I for one, cherish the fact that I can replace the battery with ease (and the micro SD card as well!). Battery life is standard for a phone with a screen this size, you'll get a good day's use out of it. I played a good amount of Monument Valley on this device and the performance was adequate, although at one point the phone's processor hit 68.7 C, which was of concern. For everyday use from a college student standpoint, this phone does it right.On a concluding note, phones such as this are a life saver; high-end phones will fall out of your hands and break and the cost of repair or replacement are burdensome. I scored this phone for below 100 USD thanks to Amazon's warehouse deals (it had been opened but not used). Truth be told I am clumsy with my mobile devices and the fact that this phone does everything I need it to do, yet if it were to break as a result of my tendencies I will not worry as much when replacing it with another BLU device, which I will definitively be considering for my next mobile phone purchase.",11.0,Positive

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"Just received this phone. Everything seems to work as it should. No issues at all. Pictures aren't bad at all. Wondering if folks complaining that photos are blurry removed the film covering the lens? Power drainage does seem a bit quick, but I installed an app killer to conserve battery and it's fine. Mostly using this phone for business and light social media, so not burning the battery by playing games (that is what my tablet is for).Edit July 31, 2015: So I've had this phone for a little over a week. Everything still functioning with no glitches or hiccups. The only complaint is that the vibration feature on the phone is weak. Unless I have it in my hand, I wouldn't hear the buzz or feel it in my pocket. Oh, I also noticed some blurry pictures. The camera tries to auto focus constantly, so if you have a shaky hand, your pics will blur. To remedy this, you can play around in the camera settings so that you don't leave it all up to the phone to auto adjust everything when taking pictures. In regards to the battery, I found that it drains faster if you toy around with the phone (swiping back and forth on screen, opening and closing apps), instead of leaving it alone while streaming something. For example, I would boot up a music app and a run tracker app for my exercise routine. The run app is known to be an energy hog. I would run for about 2 hours when the battery is at 98% and come home to check and it would be at 78%. That's not too bad. But! If I start playing around with the phone trying to upload my run log and check messages or emails afterward, I can lose 5%-10% battery life in 5 minutes. For this reason, I highly suggest getting a portable battery bank if you are considering to get this phone.",2.0,Neutral

I replaced the battery one time because it stopped working suddenly one day, but the replacement is still going good. Call quality is still clear and the speakers are still like new with daily music jam sessions. I even still have the headphones they came with and those are still working better than newer ones bought from the store.I've loved this phone so much I suggest it to everyone looking for a good phone for an awesome price.

The battery thing bugs me a little but it's still pretty usable. I can sit here and play games on it for hours so carrying it around for a day should be fine. Don't count on finding a lot of cases for it though. I did find one website that offered maybe 5 soft graphic cases that I didn't like and on Amazon here there are a lot of ugly plain wallet type cases. Make sure to use a screen protector too, I think the screen is plastic or acrylic. It doesn't feel or look cheap but still...",1.0,Positive

The only down side to this camera is using the camera in HD mode often results in blurry photos as you have to hold the phone perfectly still.

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"My review is divided into sections based on things I want to comment about.UI: Nice, snappy, bright and clear display.BATTERY: Battery lasted a day with some usage, and some phone calls, at the end of the about 30% was still remaining. Drains faster with wifi enabled.BLUETOOTH: Didn't work with Toyota Prius, connection always fail. That was a bummer for me.VOICE INPUT: Voice input is very accurate. Even though I am not a native speaker, it still gets me right every time!SYSTEM UPDATES: Received two system updates, one from March, and one from April. Currently running build ""BLU_D535U_V10_GENERIC 29-04-215 14:24"".SOFTWARE UPDATES: Received updates for several Google apps.CELLULAR DATA: I use PureTalkUSA that is an AT&T MVNO. Data connectivity on PureTalkUSA worked like a charm. Showed 4G and browsing was pretty fast.STORAGE: After all these updates and having installed Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook Messenger, storage shows 4.82GB available. Not bad at all.MULTI-TASKING: I'm running Facebook, Messenger, Messaging (that's system's SMS app), WhatsApp, Chrome with a couple tabs, Play Store, Google (that voice driven search app), YouTube, Gmail, and phone response very well. Switching is fast. No issues to me. My $300+ phone is slightly better but I honestly cannot complain at this price point. It is definitely performing much better than my expectations.Overall I am pleased with the phone and do recommend it if you don't have to pair it with Prius. But since I rely heavily on car's bluetooth connectivity, unfortunately it is not a keeper. It will be a great phone for my wife though. I'll pass it on to her.",2.0,Positive

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,5,"I ordered this phone six months after spending $200 on an Alcatel one touch because it erased my memory card and I would have to reboot it at least 8 times a day to get it to acknowledge my sim card. Needless to say, I was very irritated and had next to no expectations outside of having a phone that I wouldn't have to reset whenever a stray wind blew by. So, I had the BLU shipped overnight and was happy when it was on my doorstep less than 18 hours later. I had no problems having my straight talk service switched over and syncing my new, very vibrant yellow phone. Its been a few weeks now and I couldn't be happier, this phone is everything its hyped to be. The speaker is loud, the picture is clear and crisp, the screen is incredibly responsive and gaming is awesome. The battery life is fantastic, I work 10 1/2 hour shifts all while listening to YouTube and I wind up having to charge it partially sometimes. Every other phone I've tried this with I've ended up charging every three hours or so. I use this device as a computer, an mp3 player, a camcorder, a camera, a television, a newspaper and a phone and it has surpassed all my expectations. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a dependable device that can take heavy use.",1.0,Neutral
"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,1,"This might be a nice phone but for me it has been the phone from hell. I purchased the phone with the intention of using it on the H2O wireless network as a pay-as-you-go phone. IT HAS NEVER WORKED as advertized to send either or both ""text"" messages [sms] or ""picture messages"" [MMS] messages. This is after at least 4 calles to 4 different customer service representative and one technical specialists from H2O wireless. While H2O has tried they just can't seem to get the right combination of settings to make everything work on their network. I do however give them credit for trying.If I use ""messaging"" [you know the green smiley face app] I can send text message and MMS messages but the MMS messages appear on my wifes Samsung Android phone as a video file not a picture file.If I use ""Messenger"" [the Google app] I can send text messages but I can't send MMS picture messages.And I haven't even tried to do a video chat using ""Hangouts"" yet to my grandkids which is another big WANT on my list of functions that work.At this point it seem I have about 2 options left.1. To try another pay-as-you-go cell phone providers SIM card and see if that works any better or;2. Just stop fighting this beast and return the thing to Amazon.It should not be this difficult to make a cell phone work. You should just be able to install a SIM card into a phone and it should work. In my case it has been two weeks of numerous phone calls and emails to both H2O and BLU [which has not responded in 3 days by the way] to people whose first language is most certainly not English. This of course complicates the difficulty of making the phone function. I sincerely hope no one else has these types of problems since this BLU phone is really a nice device.The decision I am facing is two fold. Do I try another cell provider [and their SIM] and just forget the $20 I have paid H2O or do I return the device to Amazon. Decision, decisions. If anyone has any suggestions I would certainly appreciate your comments.Tom GarvenLake Havasu City, AZ.",1.0,Neutral

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"I love this phone! I was skeptical at first because it's not a well known brand but I decided to take a chance with it after buying an unlocked HTC Desire 610 and having it fail miserably. I bought it straight from amazon in pink (the most affordable color! Lucky me! I love pink.) and it arrived in 2 days with no problems. Here are some pros and cons about this phone:Pros-Comes in colors and looks great!-Affordable!-Comes with accessories (Screen protector, case, earphones)-Good amount of internal storage-NO BLOATWARE! #1 reason why I bought this phone. No unnecessary apps come installed besides Google apps but those can be uninstalled if you don't want them. You have no idea how good it feels be be able to uninstall Google+! :)-Decent camera compared to my old phone which was an LG L9-Battery life is great compared to my old phone. At 100% it can last me all day and a few hours the next.-Works smoothly and is pretty fast!Cons-Can't change the lock screen wallpaper, not a big problem but most phones have that option-No keyboard swipe but you can just download a swipe keyboard-The camera can take a while to focus-No 4G LTE but 4G is fast enough for what I do. You can get the BLU STUDIO HD LTE 5.0 if you need LTE its just a few $$ more-No way to remove the Google search bar from the home screens. I got used to it and don't mind it since I use Google a lot.-The only way to wake up the screen is with the lock button. The other buttons don't do anything if the screen is locked.-Uses a standard sim card :( I had buy another sim card since I had a micro-Not many good looking cases for this phone.I have not had any problems with this phone yet. I have also dropped it a couple of times. The case fits snuggly on the phone and I was scared the phone would not have enough protection but so far it's been fine. No scratches, no cracks. One of the best phones I've owned and the most affordable too. I would definitely recommend this phone and will for sure be buying my future phone from BLU. :)",1.0,Neutral

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,2,This phone is ok for the money. It is somewhat awkward to use and is clearly in need of some fine tuning. There are only two things on this phone that makes it a dealbreaker are as follows.1. The battery life is poor. This phone needs to be charged at least once every two days with very little use.2. The main speaker you would normally use to talk to people during a phone call became extremely distorted after only 4 months. It is as if it is blown out already with just normal use. I keep the in call volume as low as possible and it is still very loud. All in all it is a cheap phone with a lot of good features. I have contacted amazon and am waiting to see what they are willing to do for me. I will update later about how good blu's customer service is.Update: After contacting Open Group Wireless about all these issues I received no offer from them to take care of me via a warranty service or a new phone. Amazon is refunding my money in full and all is well. Gotta love amazon.I have since bought a new phone and people are telling me how much more clearly they can hear me than with my old phone so apparently the microphone was also very poor.To summarize this phone pretty much sucks. It will get you by in a pinch but don't be surprised when you start having issues with it. The battery is very poor from day 1 which is almost a deal breaker right there.,2.0,Neutral

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,1,"I had originally given this a 4 star rating because although it had problems it also offers a lot of great features for the price...fast forward a couple weeks and the phone is no longer working. Nothing happened to the phone but it randomly quit working. No new apps, no updates, no falls, no moisture...it just suddenly started restarting repeatedly. It would do that for a minute or so then shut off and I couldn't get it to come back up without a battery pull. Now it won't come back on at all, the screen just flashes. I did try a factory reset during one of the few times it last that long but it didn't help. Removing the sim and memory card didn't help and neither did updating it. I wrote customer service via the blu products website yesterday but I haven't gotten any type of response yet. Looking online showed that it's not an uncommon problem with this phone. I'll give more stars if they fix the problem without a hassle.Other bad things to keep in mind: The time zone sets wrong and has to be changed every time the phone dies or the battery is pulled, the automatic time zone feature needs to be disabled. The alarms don't always work (even when set perfectly), the screen is plastic and scratches insanely easy, cases are impossible to find. I ordered a case from the one and only website I could find that said they sold them for this model and when it arrived it was for something else and was labeled incorrectly, the phone will constantly tell you that you don't have a sim card in the unused slot even though it's obviously not a requirement...The pros: The display is large and bright, the touch screen reads correctly and easily, the phone is beautifully designed, the speaker is loud",26.0,Neutral

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,5,"*Just in case Amazon is combining reviews with other models, this is for the Blue Studio 5.0 C HD D535U, Yellow, for $119. This model is 8 GB storage with radio bands best for the United States with HSPA+ up to 42 MBPS speeds. The D534U is 4 GB storage with radio bands best for the United States with HSPA+ up to 21 MBPS speeds. The D534L has radio bands better for international countries. I'm not certain of the storage or data speeds.*For reference I am coming from 2 years use of a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 & 1 year use before that of a Samsung Galaxy S 2.*Responsiveness -I haven't noticed any lagging. Again, I bought the 8 GB. I have my Samsung Class 10 32 GB micro SD card installed. I would even say it's slightly more responsive than my Note 2. I don't do any gaming. I check email, browse the internet, shop, edit Google Docs & Sheets, etc, and of course make phone calls & send receive sms/mms.*Data speeds - If you're experiencing slow data speeds, do not rely on the automatically configured settings when inserting your SIM. Check with your carrier for the proper settings. My phone displays 4G. I have not noticed slower speeds compared to LTE on my previous phone. This may be due to the responsiveness of the processor.*Sound & volume - Speaker volume is just fine for calls. I don't have anything negative to say. For watching videos, I've needed to turn it down slightly.*Fits well in my smaller hands. It can definitely be used one handed with no modifications. Lighter weight.*Screen viewing for videos, texts, & pictures is fine. No issues. I was concerned about the slightly smaller screen from my Note 2 (5.5 to 5.0), but it's no adjustment at all.*Color is a neon yellow, not like a banana yellow, but not like glow in the dark neon. It's a nice looking phone.*Accessories - The box it came in is plastic & really nice. The case, headphones, & charger are all adequate. I installed the screen protector (bubbles underneath from dust but that's not Blu's fault) & it doesn't take away from the quality of the screen.*Keyboard - I did have to download the Google Keyboard from the Play Store to get gesture typing. Not a problem at all.*Camera - I use a DSLR for my main camera, but I do want my phone to have a capable camera. Lots of settings or just use auto scene detection. Definitely not as good as my sister's iPhone 6 & maybe not as good as my Note 2, but I would feel comfortable printing out 4x6 prints taken with this phone.*Durability - I dropped it on black asphalt the first day. I was very disgusted. Screen did not crack. I do see a small pin dot size chip, but I can't feel it when I run my finger over it. There is a black, plastic bezel around the screen which ended up with a minor chip that can't be seen when holding the phone at an arm length distance & can not be seen with the case on.*Battery life - I am not having the battery life issues others have had. I do plug it in when I'm home & not directly using it. There is battery left over at the end of the day, & I fully charge it overnight.*Bottom line - I just really can't find anything to complain about with this phone. I wasn't expecting much for $119 but I think it's as good as my Note 2 that costs me $550 2 years ago. My daughter is wanting a new phone when she heads to college in the fall. Her Samsung Galaxy S Relay has slowed down significantly even with 2 factory resets. I'm encouraging her to look into one of these instead of spending several hundred on another Samsung.",52.0,Neutral

Wireless and Bluetooth work as they should, and 4G network activity is as expected. The only minor concern that I have is the screen. Yes, they do provide a screen protector, but it's difficult to apply properly. I wonder why they don't use Gorilla Glass or something similar.

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"I have owned this for 4 months now and I am happy as a clam. Here are some features not mentioned in other reviews. There is a notification light that flashes green with notifications and turns Red when charging. The Blu phone updated it self the first day I used it. It updated the phone again 3 months later with new features. Glad to see Blu keeping their phones up to date. The camera takes pretty good pics. One surprise with the camera is that if you hold down the shutter button the camera will take about 22 pics in aburst mode. Cool. If you are in the Google user base you will find all your contacts, etc will sync with this phone. Also have all the apps in the Google play store. Voice commands are cool too. Just press the mic button on the home screen and say...set timer for 5 minutes, or what is the weather or set calendar appointment...again a nice feature. If you get this phone be sure to order the case made by Blu. There are 2 availible, a hard shell and softer shell cases that fit. Make sure you order the one that has the rear facing camera to the left and not center. There are 2 Blu phones that are similar but you need the one for the Blu Studio 5.0 C HD D534. The case fits absolutely perfectly. Wifi works great and locks on to weak signals if necessary. Another cool feature is a slight vibration when keys are pressed. Giving you a feel of definitely making contact with the screen. This can be turned off if you don't like taptic feedback. Phone quality is great and so is the speaker phone. Now the bad news...the battery needs to be bigger. If you carry this around and use it often or have Facebook eating up all those check-ins you may find that 8 hours of constant use will drain the battery to almost nothing. However, if you are a casual user you should get by on one charge. Personally if I am going to watch a movie on this I need to be plugged in with a charger. I found additional batteries are available for sale if you need more power. Also to clear things up, this phone uses the large sim card that was the normal size 4 years ago. No micro or mini sim here.PS: I have a pre-paid phone sim that I got years ago form 7-11 store that uses the ATT network. Unfortunately, there is not data plan available so all my internet is from wi-fi.",5.0,Neutral

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"Good for $100 but has no gyro for VR/Google Cardboard, etc. Camera works well.BAD: On my unit the backlight (or some kind of light) is way too visible and ruins the display in that one (pea-sized) area (lower left of screen in portrait mode about an inch in). When I called BLU they wanted me to take a picture of it and acted like it was my fault. Other issues: the volume control is pretty much loud to louder and you can't set a low volume on it - that is, when the UI shows the smallest setting (it's a discrete position) it is about 50% loud instead of 5%. It's like the designers don't know about logarithms or ?!#$@?! Not a lot of room for programs, but does hold the basics.GOOD: The camera quality is excellent - both front and back. The screen is still clear with no scratches after being used for six months - quality glass - and I'm not even using a screen protector. It's beautiful. Size is good. Back cover is good. Orange color is... well, unique... not easy to lose. It works with H2OWireless. The external memory slot is very useful, just requires a bit of hassle to move as much as you can to use the SIM. Battery life is very good compared to my earlier mini-S4 (lost down the highway - really).OVERALL: Good value, I think, but I'd like BLU to be a bit more proactive on the quality control issues (mentioned above) and the audio. I've yet to find a phone that doesn't cost a fortune to do what this one does for the money, so, I'm giving it a 3.5 (rounds up to 4) but it's really an ""okay plus"".",0.0,Positive

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"(see addendum below)After using this phone on and off for several days, I'm putting it away to be used as a backup if needed. It is a great phone, particularly for the price, but there are numerous annoyances in the operation. There is no call reject list - it apparently relies on installing an app to handle that. Some might see that as an advantage, but for me it is annoying -- I want it built-in like every other phone I've owned.The call log is a bit weird in that the 'favorites' is the main phone/call screen. Just a bit strange.On the positive hand it does seem to have good features and capabilities for managing the dual sims for phone/sms/data usage/assignment.Battery usage/life seems a bit high in that the battery is quickly depleted....keep a charger handy!Its a good phone, but too many little annoyances for me to use as my primary phone, I'll stick with my $50 LG Optimus 90 for now.Addendum: After installing 'Calls Blacklist' app I'm using this phone as my primary phone. The screen is much better than my LG and now that I've got past the annoyances I love it. It also has a built in FM radio which I use daily. My only minor issue at this point is that the battery life is a bit low, but I can live with that!Also the GPS/Positioning leaves something to be desired, particularly when using with Google Skymaps. :(",1.0,Neutral

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,5,"I was looking for an upgrade phone from my iphone 4 and wanted to go back to an android phone. I use prepaid no contract service by Straight Talk. I wanted a phone that was going to be heavy on my pockets. I was searching on Amazon for phones when the Blu Studio phones came up. I have never heard of Blu Studio so I was curious. I had read several reviews from customers and was please the majority of the reviews I read were very favorable. I decided to buy the Blue Studio 5.0 HD in pink. I have had it now for about two weeks and I love it. Setting up the phone was easy. I just popped my slim card in from my iphone and I was up and running. I love the large screen, great volume, excellent picture taking and 4G speed. I have no complaints. My 19 year old daughter was also in the market for a new phone and recommended the Blu Studio 5.0 HD and she loves it. She said she couldn't be happier and we both love the affordable cost. We are so glad we didn't spend a lot of money on one of the other top cellphones on the market. I will definitely buy a another Blu Studio in the future when I'm ready four another upgrade again.

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,2,"Phone started out great, then went down the drain no less than 6 months later (it was so great I convinced my brother to buy one) I was drawn in by the low price, and then 6 months later started running into multiple problems. The first is that BLU will not be updating this phone to Lollipop or Marshmallow, which I thought was weird since it was only released last year. It wasn't a huge problem at first, just a mild inconvenience. (Some apps might not be the latest version, big whoop.) Then I ran into a huge problem where it would disconnect me from the cell towers and I would have to call T-Mobile in order to receive texts. This was/is extremely frustrating. My last problem was the battery just randomly decided to drop out on me and I had to spend $20+ for a new one. Overall, it was great while it lasted, but really not meant to be in for the long haul.

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,5,"Based on customer reviews, I ordered this phone for my son's birthday, which was postponed several times due to bad weather. Finally, the day before his birthday party my LG Optimus L90 fell face down and stopped working. My son allowed me to use his phone for a week while a second one was on our way. Well, this Blu cell phone really shines, free of bloatware, is fast. Streams youtube video without a glitch, downloads apps over T-Mobile network or wi-fi with ease. Also takes more than good pictures and 1080i video. I think it is a real value, it's all plastic, most are, but feels solid and heavy. Screen is bright, I downloaded Music Player + and my music sounds just great, like I never heard it before, either is the app or great electronics in this phone. GPS works like a charm, I recommend this Blu Studio 5.0 HD C to anybody willing to save big money and having a great phone. Reviewers complain about battery life but what can you expect of it with such a large screen? Just get an extra battery or carry a charger with you.",2.0,Positive

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,3,"Had my doubts about getting a BLU phone since it's not exactly a very well-known brand, but man, this phone was amazing!It ran smoothly, battery life was great, the display looked sharp enough, both cameras had very good picture quality (Surprise, I wasn't expecting that on a phone on this price range) and the thing CAN take a beating: It fell from me quite a few times, I'm not used to phones of this size, but it comes with a plastic case that's tougher than you'd expect.The only downsize is, I guess, the size of this thing (It's a Phonezilla! It did fit in my pocket though), and can be a bit uncomfortable to use when plugged in, but nothing major. I was pretty happy with my purchase.HOWEVERSometime around April I received a notification for a ""Wifi-update"" available. After verifying it was from the BLU company itself my logical impulse was to accept and allow the installation. Big mistake, there was a problem with the update and the system was left unusable, sending me straight into Recovery Mode whenever I turned it on.""No big deal,"" I thought, ""this happens to androids all the time, I just have to re-install the system."" Was I wrong...There are no drivers out there for this thing, or at least working ones. Not being that tech-savvy myself I took it to several phone repairmen who install the system on ""Bricked"" phones for a living, none of them has been able to get into this thing.And so, I'm left with a beautiful piece of unusable hardware.My advice: Get his phone, it's an amazing deal, just DO NOT UPDATE IT! It works fine out of the box, stick to that system.",1.0,Positive

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,1,"I have had this phone for a week and am quite pleased.It's fast enough for my needs.I find I am doing more web browsing on the Blu Studio 5.0 C HD than my previous phone since the screen is much larger and easier for me to read, so no need to go to a PC/ Laptop.How I use my phone is mainly for voice calls (imagine that), text messaging, picture messaging and taking pictures as notes ie tags on stuff with model numbers etc. to research later.Let me summarize my impressions so far.Mobile carrier is T-Mobile; I put the SIM card in and it took off running with no other settings needed to be made.Voice calls;others report my calls are much clearer than before. I am using my same Bluetooth headset, and talking form the same locations, so it must be the phone.I don't know how and I don't care. Call volume on phone and on Bluetooth is good and speaker phone is good enough for a group to hear.Data on carrier;specs say it will only do 4g, no LTE, but that is fine for me. Solid and I am able to watch video on the data plan.Wi-Fi;works great. For the first time, I had a phone with a big enough screen to watch a movie on, but I just tried calling up the move, I would not bother to watch on such.GPS;used this for driving directions and Google Maps worked fine.There does not appear to be an actual GPS built in, but the Google magic seems to work. However, if you are not going to be around Wi-Fi as in a populated area, better try a phone with an actual GPS built in.I tried a couple apps to test the GPS and though the apps installed, there was no reporting of location through the apps.GPS Test by Chartcross,GPS Status by MobiWIA andGPS Esssentials by MicataleMessaging;I am finally able to group message like with my Blackberries of old.Others reported my responses to group messages would wreck the thread since my responses came as individual replies eve if I added each person on the thread into the same message- must be an Android limitation since I also tried using other messaging apps before.Battery life;No more anxiety! Battery has lasted all day and plenty left. +- 30%.Charging occurs while I sleep, so I have no idea how long charge to full takes.Camera;Nice enough pics- it's a phone for goodness sake. I have the resolution turned down to 2M pixel.First shot is ready very quickly, just as soon as you open the app.Next shot ready right now- as fast as you can tap the button.Video camera;Just a quick few videos taken look fine when transferred to PC.Screen;This is the biggest phone I have owned. It is almost awkward to hold, but nice to look at. Definitely a two hand phone to use.Notification light;Love it.this should be standard on all phones.I will update this review at a later date when I have used the unit for longer to comment on durability and such.I hope this helps.** Update September 2015**Updating the rating to 5This phone continues to impress me.Here are a couple other features I have accessed* Used OTG cable to directly access a USB thumb drive* Used a 2nd SIM card when out of USA* Created a WiFi Hot SpotI particularly like the location of the ports - on top of the phone. Very good layout, since the orientation of the phone is vertical while in use and therefore you can use the phone with the headset inserted or while charging.*** UPDATE*** MAY 20, 2016RATING dropped to 1 star.I am losing faith in BLU products.Support is non-existent.Until a few months ago, phone was fine- I kept recommending this to friends and family.I bought one for my wife and recently another relative got the BLU - Studio C HD, which is the updated version of my phone.Now, I am unwilling to recommend this phone.I began having problems short battery life and with the WiFI would not stay connected.When I switched internet providers at home, the problem became unbearable.BLUproducts.com website is of no helpService Support 877-602-8762 does not answer the phone nor respond to messages I left.As I searched for a solution, I see others began having this problem after an update.My phone isModel numberBLU Studio 5.0 C HDAndroid Version4.42Baseband VersionMOLY.WR*.W!#!%.MD.WG.MP.V34,2014/04/12 09:48Kernel Version3.4.67Build NumberALPS.KK.MP1.V2.10So to you BLU- I say put my phone back the way it was and you will have me as a customer again.It will be difficult for me to remain a customer otherwise.",13.0,Neutral

Therefore, I'll make this quick.When comparing this phone to $300 or $400 phones, this phone is about equal in quality. Really, this phone is amazing. I bought one for my wife 6 month's ago, and it is still working as good as new. Some people were complaining about the battery life, but I can go all day without charging. However, neither myself or my wife are constant cellphone users. I guess if you were on your cellphone multiple times an hour, I could see the battery life being poor, but let's be honest, even top brand cellphones have that issue.Overall, when you have to choose between shady Chinese phones and top brand $400 phones, BLU is a good middle ground were you can get quality product for a reasonable price.",1.0,Positive

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"This phone is amazing for the price. You get 1GB RAM and 8GB storage. It is very fast and smooth. Keeps up pretty well on games. Has a truly beautiful HD screen. It runs nearly stock Android Kit Kat. There are no built-in Facebook, BLU or whatever apps.. It's so stock I had to get an app to play Windows Media Player files!It doesn't do LTE, but it runs 4G on AT&T network as long as you put your sim in slot 1. I use GoPhone. It has two full size sim slots. It had the right APN settings from the start. I've been using a Samsung Rugby Pro for my everyday phone, and the BLU seems to run the browser and apps faster. The micro usb charging/data port is on top, which is a little weird. Actually, it allows you to put your phone in a car cup holder while charging without turning it upside down. Not a big issue, but kind of convenient.The lock button is on the right side and volume rocker is on the left. The speaker gets pretty loud playing media, and the earpiece is just loud enough for phone calls. Wi-Fi and bluetooth connectivity are pretty good. BLU even sends you a screen protector, soft case, earbuds, usb charging cable and AC wall adapter.I really enjoyed this phone, until I noticed how quickly the battery drops off. If the phone is just sitting around idle, the battery holds up pretty well. Just checking email or web browsing will cost you significant battery life. Watching videos will drain it faster. I started the day out with 84%, and was down to 15% by 4 or 5 pm. I listened to Spotify for about a half hour in the morning, then listened to the music player for about 50 mintues on bluetooth headphones. The screen was off while I was listening to music of course. I didn't make any long phone calls, and I did a little texting.I know I'm not the first person to complain about the battery. It's a shame, because everything else about this phone is great. It will do everything you would expect out of a budget phone, and do it well. Just make sure you have a charger handy. If this phone had a better battery, it would be hard to beat.I'm going to try the newer model Studio 5.0 C with Android Lollipop and see if that does any better.{{ Update }} I tried the 2015 Studio 5.0 C with Lollipop. While it does have better battery life, it doesn't perform nearly as well as the 5.0 C HD. The new model also has a slightly smaller screen. I have returned both phones now. I wish I would have kept the 5.0 C HD! I'm seriously considering ordering it again. It is asking a lot of a $100 phone to perform well and have good battery life.{{ Update 7/2/15 }} I ordered this phone again, and I am very happy with it. I've been using it for a couple weeks now, and the battery issue isn't as critical as I had thought. If it's fully charged in the morning, it will last you all day with moderate use. I've gotten most of two days out of it a couple times. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid budget phone with a great screen.",2.0,Positive

This is a good value phone with many features at a much lower price than offers from Samsung and Apple. On the other hand there is one issue that I noticed when speaking with someone who is using this phone. The microphone. If you ever heard of someone talking directly in to a microphone by being too close to it and producing a muffling sound, this is what this phone sounds like when I call it. I'm not sure if this is some kind of defect or not but having the person switch to a different phone made the problem go away. This is a problem since I can't understand what is being said.

Unreal. What's worse is that they first said they'd send a replacement within 5 days, but when one didn't show up, I called back and was told that the rep was undereducated and wrong, and I'd have to mail it in to be repaired and go without a phone for 2+ weeks.",0.0,Neutral

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"Got this phone for my girlfriend...from the image on Amazon, the color seemed more fuchsia, but in reality it's more hot pink. The phone itself runs very well so far, and it's easy to setup if you have experience with android phones. It comes with plenty of apps bundled and really not much bloatware. The package includes a charger, an earphone, a case protective cover, and screen protective cover. The camera takes pretty good pictures and has a lot of options. The phone runs smoothly thus far without any problems. My girlfriend does not game with the phone so I can't tell you if that would affect the performance of the phone. The phone comes installed with Kitkat OS. The phone also notifies you if you want to upgrade to newer version, but it seems to come up with a network error when I continued with the upgrade. So, not sure if the phone can be upgraded, since in other reviews some people are having trouble with upgrading the phone. Other than that, the sound quality is good, but could be better. The screen is vibrant and clear. Overall, a great phone for it's price and it's working out for my girlfriend. If you're looking for an inexpensive replacement, or an entry phone, you should look into this one.Update: My girlfriend had the phone for over an year and still loves it. For anyone else thinking of getting a BLU phone for long term use, an issue has arised that I think it's important to know. The screen on my girlfriend's BLU phone cracked by itself due to stress fracture over time. She did not drop her phone at all and had the case cover on. However, she did not apply the protective screen cover. The replacement touch screen is about $15, but the plastic touch screen is pretty thin. Not really worth it at this point since the phone still works well even with a large crack on it. For those thinking of getting the phone, just be aware of the plastic touch screen; especially if you are female and tend to tap the screen with your finger nail.",0.0,Neutral

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,3,"I didn't want to spend alot on a larger screened smart phone so this is what I decided to go with.

The auto fill of words while texting is beyond irritating when it makes up words you had no intention to use - unable to turn it off. The phone vibrates when the person you call picks up and they can hear it - something else that has no option to turn off. Even with a very clean screen, sometimes it's unresponsive. The pros of the phone are: the screen size, the graphics are decent, battery life is adequate, ability to add storage (unlike the Nexus phone I previously had). sound is good (don't expect symphony hall out of any phone).

I am running it on H2O Wireless and Ported (transferred) my number from Tracfone. the porting only took 12 Hours. This is a Dual Sim phone and you need the standard or big sim card. I suggest buy them here they are much cheaper if you are going with H2O.The only drawbacks I have found are the following, The battery life is short I am lucky to make it a day. I suggest buying a second or third battery right away. They are cheap $14 gets you two.The second it doesn't seem to switch wifi hotspots all that well. I seem to have to enable and disable it when I go from place to place, not a huge deal takes literally 5 seconds.

It opens and closes apps by its self which is very annoying, Battery life is very poor have to charge it 3 times a day.

Have figures out how to turn lock screen noise off, Phone has quit turning apps off and on itself. Battery life has improved can make it through a day now, If I don't search the web very much.

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,3,"For starters, this thing does not run LTE and barely runs 4G. The feel of the phone is a little cheap. Its not very heavy and you can take the back cover off really easily. The version of android is a little old but gets the job done. On the plus side it does come with some average headphones, an okay case and a screen protector. The main camera is okay, it doesn't handle movement very well. The front facing camera is terrible. And make sure that you get the 8 GB model because the operating system itself takes up like 2 GBs. Also make sure you get a SIM card adapter for this phone because it only accepts full size SIM cards, not micro or nano cards. There are lots of flaws on this thing, here's another: This phone can barely stay attached to wifi which means you constantly have to refresh the wifi in order to stay connected. Also the battery life is terrible and it can barely make it through the day. ALL that being said, it is only $120. And for $120 it is pretty good.

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,2,"BEWARE: If 4GB of memory is not enough for you, the external SD Card memory is usable on a very limited basis. I thought that the extra storage on the SD card would more than handle all my space needs, however, not all apps (very few I have found) are allowed by the android software to be loaded onto the SD Card. Only 4 of apps on my phone could be moved to the SD Card. Also I have not found a way to move videos and pictures to the SD card. Therefore be aware that this phone has very low storage ability even though it has a SD Card slot. There is currently no space left to be able to update the operating system. The workaround for this is to ROOT the phone and load work around apps which are not supplied by bluproducts. ROOT of the phone voids the warranty.The phone is quite good for the cost and works well otherwise...

So far this phone (which I brought at a substantial discount on Prime Day and which has been supplanted by at least two newer versions) has lived up to everything I expect of a smartphone. I have it loaded with apps and it hasn't slowed down in the least from its factory condition. The sound clarity is good; the screen is clear, the settings are easy to use. I get excellent service even in a remote beach area I patrol regularly and where I previously was always nearly barless.My only complaint is the battery which seems to plummet after reaching an indication of 50% - have already drained it more than I want to think about. Second, and this may be unique to my set - is that no charger I have been able to find fits securely in the port. I will plug it in to charge at bedtime and wake to find it completely drained - apparently a butterfly had passed by and dislodged the cable.

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,2,"It is remarkable how bad this phone is after only 4 months of use. The pros are it does all the basic stuff your standard smart phone should. Nothing flashy or great, just average to good.But here is where this phone goes from ""ok"" to ""worthless"":- Randomly shuts down or restarts for no reason. Sometimes in the middle if using an app or or phone call- shuts down and won't restart without removing and replacing battery pack- camera is so bad it cannot take a picture that isn't blurry- call quality is only slightly better than a pay phone in rural Uganda- key pad is laggy and frequently unresponsive while texting or typing- the body and structure of the phone is 80% plastic making it flimsy and brittleIf you need a phone to get you by for a few months till your upgrade is available, this phone is ok.

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,5,"I can not say alot about this phone because I bought it thinking my phone was broken which it ended up not being. But I will say the short time I had it before sending it back it seemed like a very good phone for the price and the fact that it is a no contract unlocked phone, which can be used on many networks, and it is a dual sim phone, which if you like me do not know what that means, it means you can either have one sim in for personal and one for business, or one for US and one for international, whatever you choose which is way better than having to carry around two different phones. Mind you I did not use this feature. I do wish it had SWYPE but it did not. Also the color choices are amazing and very true to color. It comes with a matching semi transparent silicone case of matching color. Aswell as headphones, charger, screen protector etc...It is made of cheaper plastic and is very light weight in the hand.

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,5,"Absolutely everything it says it is. It's quick, handles everything I need it to, the battery was surprisingly better than I expected. It's more than sufficient and all of the worries I had upon ordering were quickly laid to rest upon receipt. The video, speaker, speed, call reception, and otherwise overall performance were all very impressive for the delightfully low price of the device. Keep in mind that I'm coming from the impressive uses of a Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I was sick of paying an unnecessarily large phone bill and decided to bring my own device to a much more cost effective provider. (Works great with Cricket by the way)If I had ANY complaints (and I mean if I absolutely HAD to say something wasn't perfect) maybe I would just say that every once in a while, when my device is sending AND receiving too much information at the same time, sometimes I have to go to the quick settings in the notification bar and toggle my WiFi connection off then back on (by the way this takes less than 2 seconds) and to be honest that's because I tend to really push my phone. This only really happens when I'm trying to load a web page and someone just happens to be sending me a picture or something at the exact same time. When my page won't load, I toggle the connection (again, takes just half a sec) and then I see whatever incoming message was trying to push through as my page loads. And when I consider the ridiculously low price of such an otherwise top notch device, I think to myself, ""I can definitely live with that."" I am so happy with my device. I'm relieved to not have to pay expensive phone bills or device costs for such a wonderfully pleasing device on 4G service. I'm a serious power user who doesn't want to completely drain my wallet. And the cherry on top? It's an eye pleaser. Just saying. Phones can sometimes be like people: Great inside, not so pretty on the outside or vice versa. Not that it's the first thing I look for but it's nice to have a device that's just a pretty as it is functional. Definitely worth the price and I am very happy.",2.0,Positive

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,5,"I bought the white 8G version of this phone last week. I am extremely happy with my purchase! BUT, It is a real pain in the ass to get the sim and straight talk all working together. I love this phone BETTER than my Galaxy S4! It's interface is soooooo simple. It really is made for human beings! It does not come pre-tethered to facebook or virtually any other apps for that matter. but that is nice because u get to pick and choose ur own apps from Google Play. This phone was $300 cheaper than my Galaxy. The screen resolution is beautiful. No hesitation or lags in videos. It looks and feels like a solid well-built phone. My brother has the exact same model and he loves his too. The camera is high definition and looks wonderful. I actually had to turn my brightness down just to save battery. It is almost too bright and vibrant. Just turn the brightness down a litttle bit. It saves the battery too. With very moderate use after 2 charges, I am able to get two full days out of the battery. Do yourself a huge favor and buy this phone. Except for the setup aggrivation it will blow u away. Also... make sure one of ur first downloads is an app killer, otherwise the device will run out of memory. Just keep hitting that app kil;lert everytime u use the phone and u shouldn't ever run out of memory.",53.0,Positive

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,5,Bought this phone for my 9 yr old son. It's fabulous. Pretty close to Samsung S4. I do wish they made better cases for phone.

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"Just for reference since amazon is combining all the reviews for this kind of phone: this is about my new Blu Studio 5.0C HD, orange, dual sim capable. I also ordered the matching orange Blue ArmorFlex silicon case for it which fits perfectly.I am extremely happy with this phone and the service I got so far. It arrived on time (actually a day earlier than I expected) and was in great condition. I was also caught off guard when i saw the phone came with a case of it's own. Nothing special, it wouldnt protect the phone from anything, but it's still a case. The phone was much larger than I expected as well. I was expecting something like an iPhone 5, but this is definitely a Phablet. Screen resolution is great, touch sensitivity is OK, sometimes you have to swipe a couple of times but that is probably just the screen protector (which was also included with the phone), and so are both the cameras.I got this phone so I could still use my Net10 prepaid service but not have to deal with the awful grocery-store phones. I wasn't aware of the dual Sim capabilities until I actually got the phone, and I'm only using one right now. But the one I am using works great so I can only assume it would work just as well running two.Setup with Net10 was really easy. It took about two hours after setting up for the data to kick in (up to that point I just had 1G and could only text and call), and i haven't had any issues so far. What makes me even happier about the phone is that where I live, there is only 3G available unless you have a really good phone, or go thru one of the more expensive carriers. But this phone gets 4G! And on Net10 no less. The RAM does get used up somewhat fast, but I always put Clean Master on my phones and the included RAM booster solves that problem just fine.I'll be posting another review if anything changes, but I would say this was a great buy.",,Positive

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"I bought this for my dad for his birthday. He's a mechanic and, while I wanted to get him a phone made to emphasis durability, my dad wanted something shiny with a big screen.When I first unboxed this phone, I was wary of a few things. The entire back removes from the phone and, when doing so, you get a feeling that you might break the plastic. It comes with a screen protector and rubber case, things which you usually buy separately. Free goodies sounds good, but it made me question the quality of the product even more. Lastly, there's only two android tabs for apps.Despite that, this phone does pack a lot of shine under a low price! The camera, speaker, snappiness of the operation- all are really good. My dad is in no way tech savvy, but he's made a lot of use of his new phone. I might even buy myself one of these in the future!",0.0,Neutral

Also will research if they offer any soft silicone cases, the one that comes with it is OK, but little too slippery for me personally. Overall, definitely recommend!Update.. As previously mentioned I didn't think the original case was a keeper, so I did order the Armoflex case in lime and black (it is dark grey btw) and it's exactly what I wanted, fits it perfect and gives it much sturdier feel!

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"First, this phone is replacing a Nexus 5 with horrific disfigurements on its glass screen that rendered it unusable for daily use. This phone though, at its price point, is an absolute steal. BLU has really done something great by offering a price range for unlocked phones below the 200 USD mark. The packaging was clean and enhanced the phone's initial charm (the inclusion of earbuds, case, and screen protector were an absolute plus). Its version of KitKat (Android 4.4) is relatively stable with most popular apps I use (e.g., Strava and Instagram) and is bundled with useful apps such as a file manager, fm radio app, and a sim management app. One can't help but feel (from a U.S. consumer perspective) that this phone is ideal for international travel given the dual-sim card feature.Additional characteristics make this phone standout. The camera is surprisingly apt at taking pictures from both front and back (although there is some focus lag that users will have to be patient with). The colors on the screen are vibrant and the viewing angles are as BLU describes them on their product page. As many of the phones on the market today don't have a removable battery, the BLU 5.0 C HD was a breath of fresh (or old depending on how you look at it) air; I for one, cherish the fact that I can replace the battery with ease (and the micro SD card as well!). Battery life is standard for a phone with a screen this size, you'll get a good day's use out of it. I played a good amount of Monument Valley on this device and the performance was adequate, although at one point the phone's processor hit 68.7 C, which was of concern. For everyday use from a college student standpoint, this phone does it right.On a concluding note, phones such as this are a life saver; high-end phones will fall out of your hands and break and the cost of repair or replacement are burdensome. I scored this phone for below 100 USD thanks to Amazon's warehouse deals (it had been opened but not used). Truth be told I am clumsy with my mobile devices and the fact that this phone does everything I need it to do, yet if it were to break as a result of my tendencies I will not worry as much when replacing it with another BLU device, which I will definitively be considering for my next mobile phone purchase.",11.0,Positive

If your a heavy user either bring a portable battery or be near a plug cause you'll need it. But if you are an average user battery life is very decent.

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,4,"I really was hesitant about this phone and others like this. Most new phones are $300+. I thought something was going to be really terrible about it. However, being a poor college student I had no choice but to get a cheaper phone.I received this phone and have now been using it for a few weeks. I compare this to my husband's phone (new samsung) and I am very pleased with it. It is only a little slower (not by much) than his, and a little grainier photos. Other than that, I have some bonuses he does not have on his Samsung. Duel sim card, costs only $90, and comes in pretty rad colors. Also cam with a case and screen protector. This phone also has lots of case options online.The small differences this phone has can never add up the $300 difference in my opinion. This phone is pretty amazing for the price. I think even if I could get the more fancier phone, I rather save the money since the differences are very small in my opinion.The two things that do kinda drive me crazy I hope they change is the charging port is at the top of the phone and not the bottom. It makes it hard to talk while it is charging or even use the phone. Second, it constantly says second sim card is missing. I don't use it, and wish it would turn off the notification. Other than that, this phone is pretty darn awesome! I will be back to review it in 3, 6 months and then a year.",,Neutral

The rest of it is ok but it does no good if it will shut off on you within a couple minutes of using it.Update:After looking online for a replacement battery and not finding anything withing the price I wanted. I was about to give up on the phone and buy something else. In a last ditch effort I looked at the compartment for the battery. To me it seems a little over-sized. So I took a small piece of card-stock and wedged it in there to force the battery closer to the terminals. After doing that I am no longer having any problems with the battery. If the company would make the compartment a little smaller or the battery a little bigger it would be fine. i am back to liking the phone again.,0.0,Neutral

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,5,"Phone works perfectly. I haven't had any issues with it either locking or lagging on apps so far (only owned it for about a month), and hopefully it will stay that way. I honestly do not see any reason to get a more expensive phone when this one does pretty much the same things for a much lower price (except maybe running high demanding games).The only real downside I see with this phone is the battery life. I don't have much experience with this type of phones, but this one does seem to be on the short side. Expect having to charge this phone every night even if you are a light user (my phone goes from 100% to around 35 - 45% in around 10 hours of being on at work, from which almost all of them the phone is in sleep mode), to once or twice if you are a very heavy user.

Also you can remove installed apps from screen. But this phone does not come with all that useless garbage. I love the fact that I just swapped my Sim card from my old phone into the Blu phone and chaged my APN setting to NET10 which was already programmed into the phone!! YES!! There are at least 4 other companies pre-programed. This phone plays Netflix with No issues. The Sound of calls are very loud and clear to hear though the speaker phone unlike the Cubot P9. The screen is very nice and responsive. The phone moves quickly. overall as of now this is the Best Cheap phone money can buy And I've bought alot of cheap phones!! hopefully this will be my last.

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,3,I purchased this phone with H2O as my carrier and the phone did not have full functions . It would not send or receive pictures as part of the text messaging. My carrier insisted that this was because it was a BLU phone and that they have not been able to have a single one of these phones work. I really like this phone. It was very sharp looking. The display was bright and colorful. I really wanted it to work. So this is just a heads up to H2O users that there's a good chance this phone will not work for you.Update: after quite the process they were able to get the picture messages to work but it is still has some glitches. Just a couple other things to note. This phone got pretty hot at the top of the phone where you would be holding it while talking. The battery is located lower in the phone so I am not sure why this was happening. Maybe that explains why the phone is having issues. Also the charging port is pretty cheap. The charger kept falling out if it was barely touched.,,Positive

It would not connect with mobile data at all. WiFi was fine but nothing mobile. Tried all the settings and tips I could find online. No data.Fourth problem. It would lock up all of the time and require battery removal to reboot.Fifth. No text messages. At this point it would only make actual phone calls and slowly surf on WiFi.I ordered a HTC Desire 610 from Amazon and returned this piece of BLU. Amazon was great and quick with the refund.

The sound and camera work great, the touch screen is responsive, and we downloaded recorded videos to our computer with the USB cable easily (once we figured it out). The user manual leaves a lot to be desired in terms of detailed instructions, but most of our questions were answered online anyway. There was a light-duty cover that came with the phone, but I had already gotten the heavier one recommended on Amazon. I've dropped the phone a couple of times with no damage occurring. As to the wrinkles....I couldn't text pictures until I went into the AT&T store, and they plugged in their password under the access point names setting. Then it was fine. I also noticed that using data is like a power-vacuum on the battery, it's dead in a couple of hours. But I don't use it often (only while traveling), and I try to limit/disable the apps to preserve the battery life. Talk and text alone will allow the battery to last 2 days in my experience. For my needs, it's like I just got $500 in my pocket by choosing this phone.",,Neutral

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,3,"It's not as great as my old Lumia 810two major problems I'm experiencing with this phone:1. Low Battery life2. Wifi/Data constantly dropsBatteryThe Blu Studio 5.0 C HD has a 2000 mAh battery. Which I thought was a step up from my Lumia 810's 1800 mAh battery. Big mistake. When I begin my day with 100% charge, I can just leave it on and do nothing and watch the percent drop in a matter of minutes. If i leave if in my pocket with the screen locked and turn off wifi, and data, and all location services, AND have the phone running in ""power saver mode"" with the brightness all the way down, I find that it loses 5% charge in about 10-15 minutes. This is atrocious. I'm scared to watch what happens when I actually use the phone. When I do use it to the max, with a few apps running and wifi on, i watch it lose about 10% per 2 minutes. Yes the display is 720p but that shouldn't be a problem. The windows OS must use little power or something because my lumia could last me at least one and half days. Only now, after two years, it has begun to lose charge faster, but still can get a full day of use. The lumia has a smaller display coming at 4.3"" and a really low res of 480x800 but it has a smaller batter too yet it still lasts longer than the Blu.WIFI/Databoth this phone and my old lumia 810 from about two years ago have up to wireless n and 4g hspa+ however, the blu studio 5.0 c HD constantly drops from the network. It says that it's still connected to wifi and data, but it does not update anything. I don't get new hangout/facebook messages and I can't use the browser. It only begins to work once I turn off wifi and then turn it back on, and same with data. I'm guessing this is an OS problem and i'll see if I can try it with a custom rom.If the charging port on my Lumia wasn't broken, I wouldn't have switched to this phone. I'm thinking of just getting the wireless charging shell for the lumia and a qi plate and then just using the blu only for the few android apps it offers that I need that I can't get on windows phone.",5.0,Neutral

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,5,"Just received my phone- I haven't even taken it from the plastic. My very first thought is that the dimensions stated on the Amazon page are wrong.It lists it as being 5.1"" long. Perhaps they accidentally left out a 7 in the middle of that number. It is actually around 5 3/4"". Knowing this would have made a big difference in my selection- I chose it thinking it was smaller than others. I see now at least one reviewer posted the correct dimensions, in metric, which I do understand, but still tend to think in inches and hadn't made the conversion.Now, to unpack it and see what it's like, or go back to the Blu selection to see if there is another phone of this larger size I would prefer...?I carried on with it, and so far (still first day), I have no complaints. No hoops to jump through to set it up- put in my T-Mobile PAYG sim and my O2(UK) one, it took a minute or two, but they both popped up and messaged me. It looks good, works well, does what it's meant to do. My buddy I called to test it said it sounds good. I haven't really put it through web paces yet, but it has to be better than what I was getting with my old phone (HTC Desire S).I'll let you know as I learn more.[Two weeks later]Still no problems. As many have mentioned, it may not have the best battery life but I just plug it in to my laptop when I'm home- I've yet to run out of battery.It has been pointed out that this phone isn't true 4G, but it is HSPA+, which is what T-Mobile offers and it works just fine- light years faster than my old HTC.For the price, especially considering what the name brand ones go for, I can't imagine expecting more. I'm changing my rating from 4 to 5 stars.",19.0,Positive

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,5,"So. I was worried when I ordered this phone. I was worried that it might not be what I needed. It came with a 6gb internal memory. Not 4. And I have 5gb free. The phone is fast. If you don't know how to manually work Android settings, find a friend who does it's a great phone for the price. But, it must be tweeked once you get it. The battery is a bit small. UPDATE. Still a very fast very awesome phone. The battery send to have adjusted since I cycled it....Let it completely drain and then completely charge over and over. ...And the battery life seems to last longer now. Also, I get 4g on it everywhere. Not sure why people say it's not. I even ran a diagnostic test on it! Recommend!",,Positive

"BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,173.44,3,"Worked fine until a few months in with its first update. Battery is very easily drained and dues but last long, half day at best when using any app. Restarts randomly and locks up randomly. Most apps close down randomly due to phones inability to run them well. Phone cannot run certain apps due to not being compatible/recognized. The longer I have owned it, the worse the signal of the phone has gotten. I cannot longer even get signal to make calls in my own home 80% of the time. Phone is very durable and quality of screen and camera pictures is great. OS system is fantastic. I was impressed at first, but I no longer enjoy this phone nor would I recommend it. Even with the larger memory and an internal SD memory card added, I can not have more than 8 apps total installed or the phone begins to fail. Not worth what I paid in the long run",,Neutral
